The central part of my GSOC project concerns implementing the Jacobi-Davidson method natively in Julia. It is available in [JacobiDavidson.jl](https://github.com/haampie/JacobiDavidson.jl). Jacobi-Davidson is an iterative method for solving the (generalized) eigenvalue problem. As it uses iterative solvers internally, much time has gone into improving [IterativeSolvers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl) as well. Lastly, as iterative solvers are typically used with preconditioners, I have implemented the incomplete LU decomposition for sparse matrices as well in [ILU.jl](https://github.com/haampie/ILU.jl).

## [JacobiDavidson.jl](https://github.com/haampie/JacobiDavidson.jl)
The Jacobi-Davidson implementation is ready for use and can be applied to solving the (generalized) eigenvalue problem for non-Hermitian matrices. An example can be found in [the documentation](https://haampie.github.io/JacobiDavidson.jl/latest/index.html#Example-1).

## [IterativeSolvers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl)
My contributions to IterativeSolvers.jl include 
- improving speed and memory usage in [GMRES](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl/pull/131), [CG](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl/pull/130), [Chebyshev iteration](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl/pull/145), the [power method](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl/pull/139) and stationary methods mentioned below.
- adding missing iterative methods [MINRES](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl/pull/148) and [BiCGStab(l)](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl/pull/134);
- implementating stationary methods for sparse matrices [#156](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl/pull/156);
- upgrading the package to Julia 0.6 and thereby [updating the tests](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl/pull/150);
- improving and restructuring [the documentation](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl/pull/157).

## [ILU.jl](https://github.com/haampie/ILU.jl)
Computing the full LU decomposition of a large, sparse matrix requires too much memory and computational work. By simply dropping small terms during the LU decomposition these problems can be remedied, resulting in an approximate or incomplete LU decomposition. This ILU decomposition can be an excellent preconditioner to speed up iterative methods.

As ILU for the `SparseMatrixCSC` type was not yet available in Julia, I've implemented it based on the article "Crout versions of ILU for general sparse matrices" by Na Li, Yousef Saad and Edmond Chow.

The package is completely ready for use and is well tested. An example on how to use it as a preconditioner for an iterative method from IterativeSolvers.jl is given in the readme: [https://github.com/haampie/ILU.jl#example](https://github.com/haampie/ILU.jl#example).

In a later version the package can be improved by adding different dropping strategies.
