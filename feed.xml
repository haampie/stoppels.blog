Also, when a search subspace becomes too large, a restart is necessary. This also requires removing vectors from the search space. Fortunately, shrinking the search subspace is easier in comparison to IRAM.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate> <link>http://stoppels.blog/posts/shrinking-the-search-subspace</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://stoppels.blog/posts/shrinking-the-search-subspace</guid> </item> <item> <title>Options in Jacobi-Davidson</title> <description>In my previous post I showed the defining property for Jacobi-Davidson, but it turns out that there is a lot of freedom in the remaining parts of the algorithm. For instance in how to initialize it; this post will be about exactly that.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate> <link>http://stoppels.blog/posts/options-in-jacobi-davidson</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://stoppels.blog/posts/options-in-jacobi-davidson</guid> </item> <item> <title>Jacobi-Davidson</title> <description>As part of Google Summer of Code I'm implementing several iterative methods for linear systems of equations and eigenvalue problems in Julia. Up to now I have studied Jacobi-Davidson and have a poor man's version working. The first post is about my notes on the method.</description> <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate> <link>http://stoppels.blog/posts/jacobi-davidson</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://stoppels.blog/posts/jacobi-davidson</guid> </item> <item> <title>Compile-time primes</title> <description>Anyone who has seen C++ template meta-programming must have come across the compile-time prime number generator by Erwin Unruh. Since then the language has evolved and provides a very readible alternative. In this post I'll touch on both the classical and modern approach.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate> <link>http://stoppels.blog/posts/compile-time-primes</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://stoppels.blog/posts/compile-time-primes</guid> </item> <item> <title>Hello world</title> <description>Every now and then I'll post some findings in programming and math, ranging from solutions to Project Euler exercises to numerical methods in partial differential equations.</description> <pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate> <link>http://stoppels.blog/posts/hello-world</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://stoppels.blog/posts/hello-world</guid> </item> </channel> </rss>
